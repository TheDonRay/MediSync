# 🏥 MediSync

**Your AI-powered health companion for understanding symptoms and finding nearby care.**

## About MediSync

MediSync is a comprehensive healthcare platform that helps you make sense of your symptoms and connects you with the right medical providers nearby. Built during the NYU Hackathon 2025, this project combines AI assistance with real-world healthcare navigation to give users confidence in their next steps.

## What It Does

- **AI-Driven Symptom Analysis**: Describe what you're feeling, and our AI assistant helps you understand your symptoms
- **Smart Provider Matching**: Get personalized recommendations for medical providers based on your specific symptoms
- **Location-Based Search**: Find nearby doctors, clinics, and specialists that match your needs
- **Instant Results**: Quick, actionable information to help you make informed healthcare decisions

## Why We Built This

Healthcare can be overwhelming. You wake up with symptoms, search online, and end up more confused than when you started. We wanted to create something different—a tool that combines the power of AI with practical, location-based provider information to help you get the care you need, when you need it.

MediSync bridges the gap between "I don't feel well" and "I know where to go for help."

## How It Works

1. **Tell us your symptoms** - Describe what you're experiencing in your own words
2. **Get AI insights** - Our assistant analyzes your symptoms and provides helpful context
3. **Find nearby care** - See relevant medical providers in your area on an interactive map
4. **Take action** - Choose a provider and get directions to start your healthcare journey
